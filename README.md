The base files used in the packaged (via pyinstaller) version of the basic TVT GUI.  The basic version of TVT includes a topographic visualisation tool to enhance and generate images of small topographic variations in 3d mesh files and a new tool for visualising point cloud data.  The tool, originally called 'ratopoviz', is still undergoing recent improvements in order to make it better suited for a wider variety of objects besides petroglyphs.  This work is still on going in 2025, after which additional tools will be added for the full version of TVT.
