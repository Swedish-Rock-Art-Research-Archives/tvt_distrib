Current Version Available: 2.1.0

The packaged files can be downloaded from the [TVT website](https://tvt.dh.gu.se/).  TVT is available for Windows and MacOS.  The website provides a demo of ~~version 2.1.0 which has both voice-over and captions~~ (coming soon). No installation or dependencies are required; the exectuables open as a standalone app and save the files for the visual material (e.g. icons), fonts, etc. in a temporary folder.

This repository includes the base files used in the packaged (via pyinstaller) version of the basic TVT GUI.  The basic version of TVT includes a topographic visualisation tool to enhance and generate images of small topographic variations in 3d mesh files and a new tool for visualising point cloud data.  The tool, originally called 'ratopoviz', is still maintained and will have improvements implemented in order to make it better suited for cultural heritage applications beyond rock art.
